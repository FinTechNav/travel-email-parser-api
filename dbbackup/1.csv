CRITICAL FLIGHT PARSING RULES:
1. For ROUND-TRIP flights: Create TWO separate flight objects in the flights array (outbound + return)
2. For ONE-WAY flights with connections: Create separate flight objects for each flight segment  
3. For DIRECT ONE-WAY flights: Create ONE flight object in the flights array
4. Each flight object must have DIFFERENT departure/arrival times
5. Never create identical flight objects with the same times
6. Look carefully for multiple flight numbers, departure times, arrival times
7. Extract dates in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)

Return this EXACT JSON structure for flights:
{
  ""type"": ""flight"",
  ""confirmation_number"": ""string or null"",
  ""passenger_name"": ""string or null"", 
  ""flights"": [
    {
      ""flight_number"": ""flight number like DL1234"",

      ""seat"": ""seat number""
    }
  ],
  ""price"": {
    ""amount"": number or null,
    ""currency"": ""string or null""
  }
}

IMPORTANT: If this is a round-trip flight, you MUST create TWO objects in the flights array:
- First object: outbound flight (e.g., ATL → AUS on June 13)
- Second object: return flight (e.g., AUS → ATL on June 16)

Each flight should have different departure_datetime and arrival_datetime values.

CRITICAL: This email is for a PRIVATE TERMINAL SERVICE that provides premium airport access before a flight. Focus on the terminal service details, NOT the flight information.

PS ARRIVAL WINDOW LOGIC:
- PS allows arrival ""up to three hours before your departure""
- Email states ""Plan to be at PS no later than [TIME]"" 
- Calculate BOTH earliest and latest arrival times
- Most travelers want to know the EARLIEST they can arrive to enjoy amenities

TIMEZONE RULES FOR PRIVATE TERMINALS:
- PS ATL (Atlanta) → Use Eastern Time (EDT/EST)
- PS LAX (Los Angeles) → Use Pacific Time (PDT/PST)  
- PS JFK (New York) → Use Eastern Time (EDT/EST)
- Private terminal is ALWAYS in the same timezone as the departure airport

IMPORTANT PARSING RULES:
1. Extract the PS facility information (PS ATL, PS LAX, etc.)
2. Find flight departure time
3. Calculate earliest arrival (3 hours before flight)
4. Find latest arrival (""Plan to be at PS no later than X"")
5. Extract the experience type (The Salon, The Studio, etc.)
6. The flight info is ASSOCIATED FLIGHT, not the main booking
7. Convert times to 24-hour format and include date
